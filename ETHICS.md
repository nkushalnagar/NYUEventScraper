# Ethical Considerations of Web Scraping

This project scrapes the webpage www.events.nyu.edu and we have made the following ethical considerations while working on the project: 

1. **Respect for Website Terms of Service** : Many websites have terms of service that explicitly prohibit or restrict web scraping. We have carefully reviewed `robots.txt` file of the website and made sure its ethical to scrape the website. 

2. **Data Privacy** : `www.events.nyu.edu` is a publicly available website and we have only scrapped publicly available information.We have not scrapped any personal data from the website. 

3. **Rate Limiting**: xcessive scraping can put a significant load on a website's server, potentially affecting its performance and availability for other users.To minimize the impact on website performance, we implemented rate limiting in our scraping scripts. This ensures that we do not overwhelm the server with too many requests in a short period.

4. **Respect for Intellectual Property**: The content on websites is often protected by copyright laws. Scraping and using this content without permission can infringe on intellectual property rights. We only scrape data that is publicly available and do not use it for commercial purposes without proper authorization. We give credit to the original sources where applicable.

By following the guidelines above, we conducted web scraping in an ethical and responsible manner.
